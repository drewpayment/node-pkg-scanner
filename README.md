# Node Package Scanner

üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise-grade GitHub Action and CLI tool to detect compromised packages from the Shai Hulud supply chain attack**

This tool scans your JavaScript projects for compromised packages identified in the ongoing Shai Hulud supply chain attack targeting npm packages that impersonate CrowdStrike fixes.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Dual Purpose**: Works as both GitHub Action and standalone CLI tool
- üîç **Multi-Package Manager Support**: Scans npm, Yarn, and pnpm lock files
- üíæ **Smart Caching**: Falls back to cached lists when remote fetch fails
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: YAML configuration with sensible defaults
- üö® **GitHub Integration**: Automatically comments on PRs and fails CI checks
- üè¢ **Enterprise Ready**: Suitable for air-gapped environments

## Quick Start

### GitHub Action (Marketplace)

This action is available in the GitHub Actions Marketplace. Add it to your workflow (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`):

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  shai-hulud-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: drewpayment/node-pkg-scanner@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The action will automatically:
- Scan your repository for compromised packages
- Comment on pull requests if issues are found
- Fail the CI check when compromised packages are detected
- Support npm, Yarn, and pnpm projects

### CLI Usage (Clone Repository)

Clone and use this tool directly with Bun for local scanning:

#### Prerequisites
First, install Bun if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
Or visit [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) for alternative installation methods.

#### Installation & Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/drewpayment/node-pkg-scanner.git
cd node-pkg-scanner

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the scanner
bun run cli scan

# Scan with custom config
bun run cli scan --config ./custom-config.yml

# Scan specific directory
bun run cli scan --directory ./my-project

# Scan without failing on detection (for reporting only)
bun run cli scan --no-fail
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# Path to the configuration file
configPath: .config.yml
Create a `.config.yml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
# Severity level for compromised packages (error, warning, info)
severityLevel: error

# URL to fetch the compromised packages list from
compromisedPackagesUrl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cobenian/shai-hulud-detect/main/compromised-packages.txt

# Root directory to scan (optional - defaults to current directory)
# rootDirectory: ./src

# Additional packages to check for (beyond the remote list)
additionalPackages: []
  # - suspicious-package-name

# Directories to exclude from scanning
excludeDirectories:
  - node_modules
  - .git
  - dist
  - build

# Cache timeout in minutes
cacheTimeout: 60
```

## GitHub Action Inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `config-path` | Path to configuration file | `.config.yml` |
| `fail-on-error` | Fail the action when compromised packages found | `true` |
| `github-token` | GitHub token for API access | `${{ github.token }}` |

## GitHub Action Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `compromised-found` | Whether any compromised packages were found (true/false) |
| `compromised-count` | Number of compromised packages found |
| `compromised-packages` | JSON array of compromised packages found |

## CLI Usage

### Scan Command

```bash
# Basic scan
bun run cli scan

# Scan with custom config
bun run cli scan --config ./custom-config.yml

# Scan specific directory
bun run cli scan --directory ./my-project

# Scan without failing on detection (for reporting only)
bun run cli scan --no-fail

# Quiet mode (minimal output)
bun run cli scan --quiet
```

### Initialize Configuration

```bash
# Create default config file
bun run cli init

# Overwrite existing config
bun run cli init --force
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Package Lists

You can provide your own compromised packages list by setting a custom URL in the configuration:

```yaml
compromisedPackagesUrl: https://your-domain.com/compromised-packages.txt
```

The file should be a simple text file with one package name per line:

```
malicious-package-1
suspicious-package-2
fake-crowdstrike-fix
```

### Branch Protection Rules

To block PRs automatically, configure branch protection rules in your GitHub repository:
```yaml

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Add or edit a branch protection rule
3. Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Add "Node Package Scanner" to required status checks

### Azure DevOps / Other CI Platforms

Use the CLI tool in any CI/CD platform:

```yaml
# Azure DevOps example (Bun with repo clone)
- script: |
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    git clone https://github.com/drewpayment/node-pkg-scanner.git scanner
    cd scanner && bun install
    bun run cli scan --directory ../
  displayName: 'Scan for compromised packages'
```

```yaml
# GitLab CI example (Bun with repo clone)
security-scan:
  image: oven/bun:latest
  script:
    - git clone https://github.com/drewpayment/node-pkg-scanner.git scanner
    - cd scanner && bun install
    - bun run cli scan --directory ../
```

## Package Manager Support

| Package Manager | Files Scanned |
|----------------|---------------|
| npm | `package.json`, `package-lock.json` |
| Yarn | `package.json`, `yarn.lock` |
| pnpm | `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` |

## Caching Behavior

1. **Primary**: Attempts to fetch latest compromised packages from remote URL
2. **Fallback**: Uses cached version if remote fetch fails and cache is valid
3. **Last Resort**: Uses embedded fallback list if no cache available

Cache is stored in system temp directory and respects the `cacheTimeout` configuration.

## Security Considerations

- **No Credentials Required**: Uses public package registries and GitHub APIs
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requires basic repository read access
- **Offline Capable**: Works in air-gapped environments with cached lists
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged and trackable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to fetch compromised packages list"**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify the URL is accessible
- Check if cached version exists and is valid

**"No package files found"**
- Verify you're in the correct directory
- Check `excludeDirectories` configuration
- Ensure package manager files exist

**"GitHub API rate limiting"**
- Provide a GitHub token with appropriate permissions
- Use the tool less frequently or implement caching

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
# With npm global install
DEBUG=node-pkg-scanner* node-pkg-scanner scan

# With Bun (cloned repository)
DEBUG=node-pkg-scanner* bun run cli scan
```
